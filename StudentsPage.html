	<div class="policy">
		<p>As per Academic Senate policy, retroactive withdrawals, which are withdrawals requested after the semester has been completed,
		shall be handled in essentially the same manner as late withdrawals. Such withdrawals shall require documentation and verification of the extenuating circumstances that
		prevented the student from completing the course(s) AND from withdrawing during the appropriate time limits during the semester in question.</p>
		<p>Retroactive course withdrawals may not be considered for courses in which the student has received an earned grade of A+ to F since it is not in the USSC’s jurisdiction to change an instructor’s assigned grade.
		If a student wishes to appeal their grade directly to a member of the faculty, they shall have a one year period from the date the grade was entered on their record to make such appeal.
		Please note that instructors may not assign late or retroactive withdrawals; only the USSC is empowered to do so.</p>
		<p>Bring or mail your appeal packet for a retroactive withdrawal to the USSC. An appeal packet includes:
		this completed appeal form, a typed/labeled appeal statement, semester-specific supporting documentation and a completed Course Withdrawal Evaluation Form from each instructor you are requesting a retroactive withdrawal.
		Partial appeals will be returned. (Faxed, scanned, or emailed appeals are not accepted.)</p>
		<p>If you wish to submit an appeal for a retroactive withdrawal from prior semester course(s) in different semesters, you must submit an appeal packet for each separate semester.</p>
		
		<p>The USSC will inform you of their decision by email which will be sent to your Queens College Office 365 Email ONLY. Decisions are usually emailed within 14-21 business days after the receipt of your completed appeal.
		Please be sure to claim your Office 365 Email account at <a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Computing/Pages/Office365.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Computing/Pages/Office365.aspx</a> if you have not already done so.
		The approval of an appeal for a retroactive withdrawal does not remove financial liability associated with the course(s).
		Financial issues should be addressed to the Bursar’s Office and/or the Financial Aid Office.</p>
